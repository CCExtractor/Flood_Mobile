# Getting Started

In order to use the mobile app, you would need the flood backend running on your local machine. There are several ways
you can do that and all these approaches can be found at [Flood WIKI](https://github.com/jesec/flood/wiki)
The way I set it up was using [qBitTorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) as the torrent client and Flood installed
using the npm distribution

## Steps

You can use qBitTorrent,Transmission or rTorrent(anyone) as the torrent client

### Install qBitTorrent 
1. Install [qBitTorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/)
2. Start the application, click the settings button and setup the Web UI. You would have to set a new username and password and with everything done,
   the qBitTorrent Web UI should be up and running in ```http://localhost:8080/```
