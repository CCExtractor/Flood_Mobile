# Getting Started

In order to use the mobile app, you would need the flood backend running on your local machine. There are several ways
you can do that and all these approaches can be found at [Flood WIKI](https://github.com/jesec/flood/wiki)
The way I set it up was using [qBitTorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) as the torrent client and Flood installed
using the npm distribution

## Steps

### Install qBitTorrent 
1. Install [qBitTorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/)
2. In the preferences, set up the Web UI. You would have to set a new username and password and with everything done,
   the qBitTorrent Web UI should be up and running in ```http://localhost:8080/```

### Install Flood

1. Install Flood using ```sudo npm i -g flood``` / ```npm i -g flood```
2. Run flood using ```flood``` command. After this, flood should be running on ```http://127.0.0.1:3000```
3. Configure the torrent client in the flood web ui by entering the url for qBitTorrent web ui and the username and password.
